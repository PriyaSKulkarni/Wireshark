# Wireshark
Computer Networks: TCP/IP 

Wireshark Lab projects, I've outlined three different labs that focus on different aspects of network communication and analysis. Each project serves as a practical exercise in using Wireshark, a popular network protocol analyzer, to understand and diagnose network protocols and traffic. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of what each lab might entail:

### Project 1: Wireshark Lab: Getting Started
In the "Getting Started" lab, the objective is to familiarize yourself with the basic features and functions of Wireshark. This may involve:
- **Learning how to capture and save network data**: This includes setting up Wireshark to capture packets on your network.
- **Understanding the Wireshark interface**: Exploring the different panels like the packet list, packet details, and packet bytes.
- **Filtering packets**: Learning how to use basic and advanced filters to view only the relevant data.
- **Inspecting common protocols**: Analyzing packets for standard protocols such as HTTP or ICMP.
- **Understanding basic network troubleshooting**: Using Wireshark to identify common issues like network delays or malformed packets.

### Project 2: Wireshark Lab: TCP
This lab focuses on the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), crucial for connection-oriented transmissions:
- **Analyzing TCP connections**: Examining the three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK), connection termination, and the sequence and acknowledgment process.
- **Studying flow control**: Understanding how window sizes are adjusted to manage data flow.
- **Exploring congestion control**: Observing behaviors such as slow start, congestion avoidance, and fast recovery.
- **TCP error handling**: Looking at retransmissions, duplicate ACKs, and out-of-order packets.
- **Practical scenario analysis**: Capturing and analyzing a TCP session to see how data is transmitted over the network and how TCP responds to network conditions.

### Project 3: Wireshark Lab: DNS
The DNS lab focuses on the Domain Name System (DNS), which resolves hostnames into IP addresses:
- **Exploring DNS queries and responses**: Capturing and analyzing DNS traffic to see how URLs are translated into IP addresses.
- **Understanding DNS record types**: Examining different DNS record types like A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, and PTR records.
- **Analyzing DNS resolution process**: Tracing the steps involved in the resolution of a domain name, including recursive and iterative queries.
- **DNS failures and troubleshooting**: Identifying common DNS issues such as non-existent domains (NXDOMAIN responses) and DNS timeouts.
- **Security aspects**: Observing potential security vulnerabilities within DNS like DNS spoofing or cache poisoning.

Each project is designed to build upon understanding of network protocols and diagnostic techniques using Wireshark, enhancing ability to analyze and troubleshoot network issues in real environments.
